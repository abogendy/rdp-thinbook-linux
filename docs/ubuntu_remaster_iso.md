## Remastering stages
-  Extract ISO contents
-  Extract squashfs
-  Recreate modified squashfs
-  Recreate modified ISO

## Script plugin model
At each of the following stages, one or more scripts can be run

- iso_pre: **after** ISO extract, **before** extracting from squashfs
- chroot: **after** extracting squashfs within extracted squashfs as chroot
- iso_post **after** creating (modified) squashfs, **before** recreating modified ISO

At each stage, the following happens:

- The corresponding directory structure under ```remaster``` is copied to
a directory named ```.remaster``` (within extracted ISO or whthin extracted squashfs as the case may be).
- If that directory already existed, it is deleted and overwritten.
- All **executable** files under ```commands``` dir will be executed in lexicographic order
- If ```.remaster/commands/commands.list``` is present, only executable files under ```.remaster/commands``` listed in ```.remaster/commands/commands.list``` are executed.
- ```.remaster/commands/commands.list``` itself is **NEVER** executed - even if present and executable.
- For each command the working directory will be .remaster/commands
- In the case of ```chroot```, commands are executed after chroot-ing into the extracted squashfs - so ```.remaster``` will be ```/.remaster```
- ```.remaster``` will be deleted after **chroot** stage. Anything that needs to be kept needs to be copied by a script under ```.remaster/commands```. Contents of ```.remaster``` is retained in extracted ISO between iso_pre and iso_post (except ```commands``` directory).
- If any command exits with an error, subsequent commands **are still executed**. To avoid execution of subsequent commands plugin command scripts must maintain state on the filesystem.

## iso_pre stage
**IF** iso_pre directory is present, commands under ```iso_pre/commands``` are executed sequentially within extracted ISO (not chroot-ed).

I have not found a use for executing scripts at this stage. Perhaps one may want to inspect and store the state of the extracted ISO filesystem for comparison with post-modification state.

## Execute chroot scripts in chroot inside extracted squashfs
**IF** chroot directory is present, commands under ```chroot/commands``` are executed sequentially within extracted squashfs (chrooted).

A lot of the interesting capabilities are achieved by scripts running at this stage:
- You want the custom kernel to be automatically installed while installing from the live ISO
- You want to install additional packages that are available in the live session AND carried into the installed image
- You want to add additional files - e.g. utilities, scripts, data files - that are available in the live session AND carried into the installed image
- You want to create an updated ISO with all packages updated

## Execute iso_post scripts within extracted ISO (not chroot-ed)
**IF** iso_post directory is present, commands under ```iso_post/commands``` are executed sequentially within extracted ISO (not chroot-ed).

Some uses:
- Copy custom kernel to location inside ISO so that live session also uses custom kernel (and initrd)
- You want to make a UEFI-compatible 64-bit Linux ISO image bootable on a machine with a 32-bit EFI loader


## Usage and command line parameters
- Needs to be executed as root (```sudo ubuntu_remaster_iso.sh```)
- Executing without any parameters provides usage help:

```
ubuntu_remaster_iso.sh ISO_PATH EXTRACT_DIR OUTPUT_ISO

    ISO_PATH:      Full path to ISO to extract
    EXTRACT_DIR:  Dir to extract under. Will be (re-)created
    OUTPUT_ISO: Full path to output ISO
```

```REMASTER_CMDS_DIR```: If this environment variable is set, it is expected to point at directory with sub-directories named ```iso_pre```, ```chroot```, ```iso_post```.
- If the variable is set and the directory is not found, no remaster commands are executed.
- If the variable is not set it defaults to ```bootutils/remaster```
- If any of the directories ```iso_pre```, ```chroot```, ```iso_post``` do not exist, they are ignored. If any of the directories are empty or commands directory is empty or does not contain any executable files, that stage is skipped

## Best practices
- Do not choose ```REMASTER_CMDS_DIR``` to be a directory name containing spaces / special characters
- Do not use spaces or special characters in names of commands in ```commands``` directory

## Sample remaster commands
