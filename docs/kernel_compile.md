# Download, patch and compile the kernel

## Packages required
The following list is for ubuntu. It should be very similar or identical on
Ubuntu flavours like Mint and very similar on other Debian distributions

```
sudo apt-get install git util-linux git build-essential fakeroot libncurses5-dev libssl-dev ccache libfile-fcntllock-perl curl libelf-dev
```

Kernel compilation scripts have now moved to [my kernel_build repository](https://github.com/sundarnagarajan/kernel_build). 

See the [kernel_build/README.md](https://github.com/sundarnagarajan/kernel_build/blob/master/README.md) for more details on how to use the scripts.
